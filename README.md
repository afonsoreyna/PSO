# Particle Swarm Optimization
The goal of this project is to find an (x,y) pair that optimizes the z coordinate for two famous 3d functions using a Particle Swarm Algorithm. 

## Eggholder Function
- Domain of [-512, 512]
- Goal of Minimization
- Global minimum at z = -959.6407, at (x,y) = (512, 404.2319)
## Inverse Drop Wave Function
- Domain of [-5, 5]
- Goal of Maximization
- Global Maximum at z = 6.007
- Imposed restraint of generation of particles in the 4 corners.
